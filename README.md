# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project is based on artificial intelligence. It mostly makes predictions about the Titanic ship's passengers' survivability. It provides a study of the individuals who were saved during that incident depending on their gender, age, and other factors. At the time, this situation was quite terrible.
